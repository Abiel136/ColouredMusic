# ColouredMusic (Simple Version)

Turn MIDI songs into colorful visualizations.

## What This Does

Converts MIDI files to colored visualizations by mapping musical notes to the visible light spectrum.

- **Horizontal position**: Time (left to right)
- **Color**: Musical pitch (low notes = red, high notes = blue)
- **Width**: Note duration

## Files

- `midi_to_csn.ipynb` - Main notebook (run this!)
- `example_converted.csv` - MIDI file in CSV format
- `dataframe.csv` - Processed note data

## Quick Start

1. Open Jupyter: `jupyter notebook midi_to_csn.ipynb`
2. Run all cells
3. Get colored PNG visualizations!

That's it!
